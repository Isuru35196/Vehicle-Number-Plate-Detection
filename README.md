# Vehicle-Number-Plate-Detection
This project detects and crops vehicle number plates from images using OpenCV-based image processing techniques. It uses grayscale conversion, noise reduction, and Canny edge detection without relying on OCR or machine learning. The system is lightweight and effective for clear, front-facing vehicle images.
